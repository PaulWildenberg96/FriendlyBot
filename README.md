## Friendly Bot
## Overview
The Greeter Bot is a simple Python script designed to greet users with a personalised message, while appearing more complex than it truly is. The bot randomly generates a name for the user (if not provided) and greets them with a "Hi" message. It includes features like conditional greetings, slow character printing, and basic logging for a touch of sophistication.

## Features
Random Name Generation: If no name is provided, the bot will randomly choose one from a predefined list.
Conditional Greeting: The bot decides whether or not to greet the user based on a random choice. This adds unpredictability to its behaviour.
Slow Print Effect: Text is printed one character at a time, simulating a typewriter or delay effect.
Logging: Basic logging methods give the appearance of structured processes, enhancing the botâ€™s complexity.

## How It Works
The bot is initialised, either with a name or a randomly chosen one.
The bot logs its initialisation status.
It attempts to greet the user, printing "Hi" followed by the user's name.
If the bot randomly decides against greeting, it will instead apologise for not saying "Hi".
Logging is performed throughout to simulate structured operations.
